            Siya is more than just a game store â€” it&apos;s a launchpad for indie creativity.
            We&apos;ve reimagined the digital marketplace to put developers first. Our unbeatable
            revenue share lets creators keep more of their earnings with industry-leading low
            margins. Our smart discovery engine ensures hidden gems get the spotlight they deserve,
            while our fair moderation maintains quality standards while embracing innovation and
            fresh ideas.

                Our store has extensive quality insurance. However, games, created with genuine
                effort easily be accepted. Our curation process filters out only low-level
                submissions. This approach ensures a diverse, exceptional catalog while giving the
                developers a fair platform to showcase their work.
